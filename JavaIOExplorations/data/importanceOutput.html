The room isluxuriously and artistically furnished.  The sound of a piano is heard inthe adjoining room.[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music hasceased, Algernon enters.]Algernon.  Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?Lane.  I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.Algernon.  I'm sorry for that, for your sake.  I don't playaccurately--any one can play accurately--but I play with wonderfulexpression.  As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  Ikeep science for Life.Lane.  Yes, sir.Algernon.  And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got thecucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Hands them on a salver.]Algernon.  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  Oh! . . .by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, whenLord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles ofchampagne are entered as having been consumed.Lane.  Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.Algernon.  Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servantsinvariably drink the champagne?  I ask merely for information.Lane.  I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.  I haveoften observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of afirst-rate brand.Algernon.  Good heavens!  Is marriage so demoralising as that?Lane.  I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir.  I have had verylittle experience of it myself up to the present.  I have only beenmarried once.  That was in consequence of a misunderstanding betweenmyself and a young person.Algernon.  [Languidly_._]  I don't know that I am much interested in yourfamily life, Lane.Lane.  No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.  I never think ofit myself.Algernon.  Very natural, I am sure.  That will do, Lane, thank you.Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Lane goes out.]Algernon.  Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  Really, if thelower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use ofthem?  They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moralresponsibility.[Enter Lane.]Lane.  Mr. Ernest Worthing.[Enter Jack.][Lane goes out_._]Algernon.  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?Jack.  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere?Eating as usual, I see, Algy!Algernon.  [Stiffly_._]  I believe it is customary in good society totake some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been sincelast Thursday?Jack.  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the country.Algernon.  What on earth do you do there?Jack.  [Pulling off his gloves_._]  When one is in town one amusesoneself.  When one is in the country one amuses other people.  It isexcessively boring.Algernon.  And who are the people you amuse?Jack.  [Airily_._]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours.Algernon.  Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?Jack.  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one of them.Algernon.  How immensely you must amuse them!  [Goes over and takessandwich.]  By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?Jack.  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Whycucumber sandwiches?  Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?  Whois coming to tea?Algernon.  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.Jack.  How perfectly delightful!Algernon.  Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won'tquite approve of your being here.Jack.  May I ask why?Algernon.  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectlydisgraceful.  It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.Jack.  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have come up to town expressly topropose to her.Algernon.  I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call thatbusiness.Jack.  How utterly unromantic you are!Algernon.  I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.  It is veryromantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definiteproposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Thenthe excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.Jack.  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.  The Divorce Court wasspecially invented for people whose memories are so curiouslyconstituted.Algernon.  Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.  Divorces aremade in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich.  Algernon atonce interferes.]  Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.  They areordered specially for Aunt Augusta.  [Takes one and eats it.]Jack.  Well, you have been eating them all the time.Algernon.  That is quite a different matter.  She is my aunt.  [Takesplate from below.]  Have some bread and butter.  The bread and butter isfor Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.Jack.  [Advancing to table and helping himself.]  And very good bread andbutter it is too.Algernon.  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going toeat it all.  You behave as if you were married to her already.  You arenot married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.Jack.  Why on earth do you say that?Algernon.  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirtwith.  Girls don't think it right.Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!Algernon.  It isn't.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for theextraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.  Inthe second place, I don't give my consent.Jack.  Your consent!Algernon.  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.  And before Iallow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question ofCecily.  [Rings bell.]Jack.  Cecily!  What on earth do you mean?  What do you mean, Algy, byCecily!  I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.[Enter Lane.]Algernon.  Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here.Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]Jack.  Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  Iwish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing franticletters to Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a largereward.Algernon.  Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more thanusually hard up.Jack.  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing isfound.[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  Algernon takes it atonce.  Lane goes out.]Algernon.  I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Openscase and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I lookat the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.Jack.  Of course it's mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it ahundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is writteninside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarettecase.Algernon.  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what oneshould read and what one shouldn't.  More than half of modern culturedepends on what one shouldn't read.Jack.  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discussmodern culture.  It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of inprivate.  I simply want my cigarette case back.Algernon.  Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.  This cigarette caseis a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn'tknow any one of that name.Jack.  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.Algernon.  Your aunt!Jack.  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.Just give it back to me, Algy.Algernon.  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herselflittle Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?[Reading.]  'From little Cecily with her fondest love.'Jack.  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what onearth is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide forherself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like youraunt!  That is absurd!  For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.[Follows Algernon round the room.]Algernon.  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  'From littleCecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'  There is noobjection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, nomatter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, Ican't quite make out.  Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it isErnest.Jack.  It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.Algernon.  You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced youto every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look asif your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I eversaw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn'tErnest.  It's on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it fromcase.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'  I'll keep this as aproof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, orto Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his pocket.]Jack.  Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and thecigarette case was given to me in the country.Algernon.  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your smallAunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.Jack.  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It isvery vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.  It producesa false impression.Algernon.  Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!Tell me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected youof being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of itnow.Jack.  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?Algernon.  I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expressionas soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in townand Jack in the country.Jack.  Well, produce my cigarette case first.Algernon.  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce yourexplanation, and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]Jack.  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanationat all.  In fact it's perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, whoadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to hisgrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as heruncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirablegoverness, Miss Prism.Algernon.  Where is that place in the country, by the way?Jack.  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited. . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.Algernon.  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all overShropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest intown and Jack in the country?Jack.  My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understandmy real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed inthe position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on allsubjects.  It's one's duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardlybe said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness,in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a youngerbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into themost dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure andsimple.Algernon.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life wouldbe very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a completeimpossibility!Jack.  That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.Algernon.  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don'ttry it.  You should leave that to people who haven't been at aUniversity.  They do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really areis a Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  Youare one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.Jack.  What on earth do you mean?Algernon.  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest,in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  Ihave invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in orderthat I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunburyis perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary badhealth, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than aweek.Jack.  I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.Algernon.  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending outinvitations.  It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so muchas not receiving invitations.Jack.  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.Algernon.  I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of thekind.  To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quiteenough to dine with one's own relations.  In the second place, whenever Ido dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sentdown with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I knowperfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.  She will placeme next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across thedinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The amountof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectlyscandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one's clean linen inpublic.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist Inaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you therules.Jack.  I'm not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am goingto kill my brother, indeed I think I'll kill him in any case.  Cecily isa little too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am goingto get rid of Ernest.  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.Algernon.  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you everget married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be veryglad to know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has avery tedious time of it.Jack.  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, andshe is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, Icertainly won't want to know Bunbury.Algernon.  Then your wife will.  You don't seem to realise, that inmarried life three is company and two is none.Jack.  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory thatthe corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.Algernon.  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half thetime.Jack.  For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical.  It's perfectly easyto be cynical.Algernon.  My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.  There'ssuch a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bellis heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors,ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way forten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing toGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?Jack.  I suppose so, if you want to.Algernon.  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who arenot serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.[Enter Lane.]Lane.  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.[Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell andGwendolen.]Lady Bracknell.  Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behavingvery well.Algernon.  I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  That's not quite the same thing.  In fact the two thingsrarely go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]Algernon.  [To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!Gwendolen.  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?Jack.  You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.Gwendolen.  Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room fordevelopments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen andJack sit down together in the corner.]Lady Bracknell.  I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I wasobliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn't been there since her poorhusband's death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twentyyears younger.  And now I'll have a cup of tea, and one of those nicecucumber sandwiches you promised me.Algernon.  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]Lady Bracknell.  Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?Gwendolen.  Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.Algernon.  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Whyare there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.Lane.  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning,sir.  I went down twice.Algernon.  No cucumbers!Lane.  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.Algernon.  That will do, Lane, thank you.Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]Algernon.  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being nocucumbers, not even for ready money.Lady Bracknell.  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had somecrumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely forpleasure now.Algernon.  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.Lady Bracknell.  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I,of course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you.I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am going to send youdown with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive toher husband.  It's delightful to watch them.Algernon.  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up thepleasure of dining with you to-night after all.Lady Bracknell.  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put mytable completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.Fortunately he is accustomed to that.Algernon.  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terribledisappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to saythat my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances withJack.]  They seem to think I should be with him.Lady Bracknell.  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to sufferfrom curiously bad health.Algernon.  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.Lady Bracknell.  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high timethat Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any wayapprove of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Healthis the primary duty of life.  I am always telling that to your pooruncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as anyimprovement in his ailment goes.  I should be much obliged if you wouldask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse onSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It is my lastreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically saidwhatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.Algernon.  I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday.  Of coursethe music is a great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music,people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk.  ButI'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come intothe next room for a moment.Lady Bracknell.  Thank you, Algernon.  It is very thoughtful of you.[Rising, and following Algernon.]  I'm sure the programme will bedelightful, after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possiblyallow.  People always seem to think that they are improper, and eitherlook shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But Germansounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.Gwendolen, you will accompany me.Gwendolen.  Certainly, mamma.[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remainsbehind.]Jack.  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.Gwendolen.  Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certainthat they mean something else.  And that makes me so nervous.Jack.  I do mean something else.Gwendolen.  I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.Jack.  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of LadyBracknell's temporary absence . . .Gwendolen.  I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way ofcoming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to herabout.Jack.  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admiredyou more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.Gwendolen.  Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wishthat in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me youhave always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I wasfar from indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live,as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact isconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and hasreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always beento love some one of the name of Ernest.  There is something in that namethat inspires absolute confidence.  The moment Algernon first mentionedto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to loveyou.Jack.  You really love me, Gwendolen?Gwendolen.  Passionately!Jack.  Darling!  You don't know how happy you've made me.Gwendolen.  My own Ernest!Jack.  But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if myname wasn't Ernest?Gwendolen.  But your name is Ernest.Jack.  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do youmean to say you couldn't love me then?Gwendolen.  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation,and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at allto the actual facts of real life, as we know them.Jack.  Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much careabout the name of Ernest . . . I don't think the name suits me at all.Gwendolen.  It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a musicof its own.  It produces vibrations.Jack.  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots ofother much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.Gwendolen.  Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack,if any at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely novibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, withoutexception, were more than usually plain.  Besides, Jack is a notoriousdomesticity for John!  And I pity any woman who is married to a mancalled John.  She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancingpleasure of a single moment's solitude.  The only really safe name isErnestJack.  Gwendolen, I must get christened at once--I mean we must getmarried at once.  There is no time to be lost.Gwendolen.  Married, Mr. Worthing?Jack.  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, andyou led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutelyindifferent to me.Gwendolen.  I adore you.  But you haven't proposed to me yet.  Nothinghas been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even beentouched on.Jack.  Well . . . may I propose to you now?Gwendolen.  I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spareyou any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair totell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to acceptyou.Jack.  Gwendolen!Gwendolen.  Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?Jack.  You know what I have got to say to you.Gwendolen.  Yes, but you don't say it.Jack.  Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]Gwendolen.  Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.Jack.  My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.Gwendolen.  Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brotherGerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyesyou have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will alwayslook at me just like that, especially when there are other peoplepresent.  [Enter Lady Bracknell.]Lady Bracknell.  Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbentposture.  It is most indecorous.Gwendolen.  Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must begyou to retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has notquite finished yet.Lady Bracknell.  Finished what, may I ask?Gwendolen.  I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]Lady Bracknell.  Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you dobecome engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permithim, will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a younggirl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It ishardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . .And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I ammaking these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in thecarriage.Gwendolen.  [Reproachfully.]  Mamma!Lady Bracknell.  In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to thedoor.  She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell'sback.  Lady Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understandwhat the noise was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!Gwendolen.  Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]Jack.  Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.Lady Bracknell.  [Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tellyou that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although Ihave the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together,in fact.  However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should youranswers be what a really affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?Jack.  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.Lady Bracknell.  I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have anoccupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as itis.  How old are you?Jack.  Twenty-nine.Lady Bracknell.  A very good age to be married at.  I have always been ofopinion that a man who desires to get married should know eithereverything or nothing.  Which do you know?Jack.  [After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.Lady Bracknell.  I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anythingthat tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exoticfruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of moderneducation is radically unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate,education produces no effect whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove aserious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts ofviolence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?Jack.  Between seven and eight thousand a year.Lady Bracknell.  [Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?Jack.  In investments, chiefly.Lady Bracknell.  That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expectedof one during one's lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one'sdeath, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives oneposition, and prevents one from keeping it up.  That's all that can besaid about land.Jack.  I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it,about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don't depend on that for myreal income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are theonly people who make anything out of it.Lady Bracknell.  A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that pointcan be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girlwith a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expectedto reside in the country.Jack.  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the yearto Lady Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at sixmonths' notice.Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bloxham?  I don't know her.Jack.  Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerablyadvanced in years.Lady Bracknell.  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability ofcharacter.  What number in Belgrave Square?Jack.  149.Lady Bracknell.  [Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thoughtthere was something.  However, that could easily be altered.Jack.  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?Lady Bracknell.  [Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What areyour polities?Jack.  Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.Lady Bracknell.  Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or comein the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parentsliving?Jack.  I have lost both my parents.Lady Bracknell.  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as amisfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father?He was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radicalpapers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of thearistocracy?Jack.  I am afraid I really don't know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, Isaid I had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that myparents seem to have lost me . . . I don't actually know who I am bybirth.  I was . . . well, I was found.Lady Bracknell.  Found!Jack.  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitableand kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing,because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in hispocket at the time.  Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seasideresort.Lady Bracknell.  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-classticket for this seaside resort find you?Jack.  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.Lady Bracknell.  A hand-bag?Jack.  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag--asomewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it--an ordinaryhand-bag in fact.Lady Bracknell.  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardewcome across this ordinary hand-bag?Jack.  In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him inmistake for his own.Lady Bracknell.  The cloak-room at Victoria Station?Jack.  Yes.  The Brighton line.Lady Bracknell.  The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feelsomewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at anyrate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me todisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that remindsone of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume youknow what that unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particularlocality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railwaystation might serve to conceal a social indiscretion--has probably,indeed, been used for that purpose before now--but it could hardly beregarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.Jack.  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardlysay I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.Lady Bracknell.  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try andacquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effortto produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season isquite over.Jack.  Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I canproduce the hand-bag at any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  Ireally think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.Lady Bracknell.  Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardlyimagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our onlydaughter--a girl brought up with the utmost care--to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing![Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]Jack.  Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up theWedding March.  Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  Forgoodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.  How idiotic you are![The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]Algernon.  Didn't it go off all right, old boy?  You don't mean to sayGwendolen refused you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is alwaysrefusing people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.Jack.  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she isconcerned, we are engaged.  Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Nevermet such a Gorgon . . . I don't really know what a Gorgon is like, but Iam quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is a monster,without being a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon,Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way beforeyou.Algernon.  My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is theonly thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply atedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how tolive, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!Algernon.  It isn't!Jack.  Well, I won't argue about the matter.  You always want to argueabout things.Algernon.  That is exactly what things were originally made for.Jack.  Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself . . . [A pause.]You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her motherin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?Algernon.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.No man does.  That's his.Jack.  Is that clever?Algernon.  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observationin civilised life should be.Jack.  I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing hasbecome an absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a fewfools left.Algernon.  We have.Jack.  I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?Algernon.  The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.Jack.  What fools!Algernon.  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your beingErnest in town, and Jack in the country?Jack.  [In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn'tquite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  Whatextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!Algernon.  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, ifshe is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense.Algernon.  What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?Jack.  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I'llsay he died in Paris of apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quitesuddenly, don't they?Algernon.  Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow.  It's a sort ofthing that runs in families.  You had much better say a severe chill.Jack.  You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of thatkind?Algernon.  Of course it isn't!Jack.  Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly,in Paris, by a severe chill.  That gets rid of him.Algernon.  But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little toomuch interested in your poor brother Ernest?  Won't she feel his loss agood deal?Jack.  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I amglad to say.  She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and paysno attention at all to her lessons.Algernon.  I would rather like to see Cecily.Jack.  I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessivelypretty, and she is only just eighteen.Algernon.  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessivelypretty ward who is only just eighteen?Jack.  Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people.  Cecily andGwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.  I'll betyou anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will becalling each other sister.Algernon.  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot ofother things first.  Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table atWillis's, we really must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?Jack.  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.Algernon.  Well, I'm hungry.Jack.  I never knew you when you weren't . . .Algernon.  What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?Jack.  Oh no!  I loathe listening.Algernon.  Well, let us go to the Club?Jack.  Oh, no!  I hate talking.Algernon.  Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?Jack.  Oh, no!  I can't bear looking at things.  It is so silly.Algernon.  Well, what shall we do?Jack.  Nothing!Algernon.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don't mindhard work where there is no definite object of any kind.[Enter Lane.]Lane.  Miss Fairfax.[Enter Gwendolen.  Lane goes out.]Algernon.  Gwendolen, upon my word!Gwendolen.  Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something veryparticular to say to Mr. Worthing.Algernon.  Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.Gwendolen.  Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towardslife.  You are not quite old enough to do that.  [Algernon retires to thefireplace.]Jack.  My own darling!Gwendolen.  Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression onmamma's face I fear we never shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regardto what their children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for theyoung is fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, Ilost at the age of three.  But although she may prevent us from becomingman and wife, and I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothingthat she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.Jack.  Dear Gwendolen!Gwendolen.  The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of mynature.  Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.  Thesimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible tome.  Your town address at the Albany I have.  What is your address in thecountry?Jack.  The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, andwrites the address on his shirt-cuff.  Then picks up the Railway Guide.]Gwendolen.  There is a good postal service, I suppose?  It may benecessary to do something desperate.  That of course will require seriousconsideration.  I will communicate with you daily.Jack.  My own one!Gwendolen.  How long do you remain in town?Jack.  Till Monday.Gwendolen.  Good!  Algy, you may turn round now.Algernon.  Thanks, I've turned round already.Gwendolen.  You may also ring the bell.Jack.  You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?Gwendolen.  Certainly.Jack.  [To Lane, who now enters.]  I will see Miss Fairfax out.Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Jack and Gwendolen go off.][Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon.  It is to besurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at theenvelopes, tears them up.]Algernon.  A glass of sherry, Lane.Lane.  Yes, sir.Algernon.  To-morrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.Lane.  Yes, sir.Algernon.  I shall probably not be back till Monday.  You can put up mydress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Handing sherry.]Algernon.  I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.Lane.  It never is, sir.Algernon.  Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.Lane.  I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.[Enter Jack.  Lane goes off.]Jack.  There's a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever caredfor in my life.  [Algernon is laughing immoderately.]  What on earth areyou so amused at?Algernon.  Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.Jack.  If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into aserious scrape some day.Algernon.  I love scrapes.  They are the only things that are neverserious.Jack.  Oh, that's nonsense, Algy.  You never talk anything but nonsense.Algernon.  Nobody ever does.[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room.  Algernon lights acigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]ACT DROPSECOND ACTSCENEGarden at the Manor House.  A flight of grey stone steps leads up to thehouse.  The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses.  Time of year,July.  Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under alarge yew-tree.[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table.  Cecily is at the backwatering flowers.]Miss Prism.  [Calling.]  Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarianoccupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty thanyours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you.Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  Wewill repeat yesterday's lesson.Cecily.  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I don't like German.  It isn'tat all a becoming language.  I know perfectly well that I look quiteplain after my German lesson.Miss Prism.  Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you shouldimprove yourself in every way.  He laid particular stress on your German,as he was leaving for town yesterday.  Indeed, he always lays stress onyour German when he is leaving for town.Cecily.  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!  Sometimes he is so seriousthat I think he cannot be quite well.Miss Prism.  [Drawing herself up.]  Your guardian enjoys the best ofhealth, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in oneso comparatively young as he is.  I know no one who has a higher sense ofduty and responsibility.Cecily.  I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when wethree are together.Miss Prism.  Cecily!  I am surprised at you.  Mr. Worthing has manytroubles in his life.  Idle merriment and triviality would be out ofplace in his conversation.  You must remember his constant anxiety aboutthat unfortunate young man his brother.Cecily.  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, hisbrother, to come down here sometimes.  We might have a good influenceover him, Miss Prism.  I am sure you certainly would.  You know German,and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.  [Cecilybegins to write in her diary.]Miss Prism.  [Shaking her head.]  I do not think that even I couldproduce any effect on a character that according to his own brother'sadmission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.  Indeed I am not surethat I would desire to reclaim him.  I am not in favour of this modernmania for turning bad people into good people at a moment's notice.  As aman sows so let him reap.  You must put away your diary, Cecily.  Ireally don't see why you should keep a diary at all.Cecily.  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of mylife.  If I didn't write them down, I should probably forget all aboutthem.Miss Prism.  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry aboutwith us.Cecily.  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have neverhappened, and couldn't possibly have happened.  I believe that Memory isresponsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.Miss Prism.  Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily.I wrote one myself in earlier days.Cecily.  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How wonderfully clever you are!  Ihope it did not end happily?  I don't like novels that end happily.  Theydepress me so much.Miss Prism.  The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is whatFiction means.Cecily.  I suppose so.  But it seems very unfair.  And was your novelever published?Miss Prism.  Alas! no.  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.[Cecily starts.]  I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.  Toyour work, child, these speculations are profitless.Cecily.  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through thegarden.Miss Prism.  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr. Chasuble!  This is indeed apleasure.[Enter Canon Chasuble.]Chasuble.  And how are we this morning?  Miss Prism, you are, I trust,well?Cecily.  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  Ithink it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in thePark, Dr. Chasuble.Miss Prism.  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.Cecily.  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively thatyou had a headache.  Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about myGerman lesson, when the Rector came in.Chasuble.  I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.Cecily.  Oh, I am afraid I am.Chasuble.  That is strange.  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism'spupil, I would hang upon her lips.  [Miss Prism glares.]  I spokemetaphorically.--My metaphor was drawn from bees.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, Isuppose, has not returned from town yet?Miss Prism.  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.Chasuble.  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.  He isnot one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, thatunfortunate young man his brother seems to be.  But I must not disturbEgeria and her pupil any longer.Miss Prism.  Egeria?  My name is Laetitia, Doctor.Chasuble.  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Paganauthors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?Miss Prism.  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you.  I findI have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.Chasuble.  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure.  We might go as faras the schools and back.Miss Prism.  That would be delightful.  Cecily, you will read yourPolitical Economy in my absence.  The chapter on the Fall of the Rupeeyou may omit.  It is somewhat too sensational.  Even these metallicproblems have their melodramatic side.[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]Cecily.  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  HorridPolitical Economy!  Horrid Geography!  Horrid, horrid German![Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]Merriman.  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  Hehas brought his luggage with him.Cecily.  [Takes the card and reads it.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, TheAlbany, W.'  Uncle Jack's brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was intown?Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentionedthat you and Miss Prism were in the garden.  He said he was anxious tospeak to you privately for a moment.Cecily.  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had bettertalk to the housekeeper about a room for him.Merriman.  Yes, Miss.[Merriman goes off.]Cecily.  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel ratherfrightened.  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  He does!Algernon.  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.Cecily.  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact,I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.  [Algernon is rathertaken aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from your card,are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.Algernon.  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn'tthink that I am wicked.Cecily.  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all ina very inexcusable manner.  I hope you have not been leading a doublelife, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.  Thatwould be hypocrisy.Algernon.  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have beenrather reckless.Cecily.  I am glad to hear it.Algernon.  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad inmy own small way.Cecily.  I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sureit must have been very pleasant.Algernon.  It is much pleasanter being here with you.Cecily.  I can't understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won't beback till Monday afternoon.Algernon.  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by thefirst train on Monday morning.  I have a business appointment that I amanxious . . . to miss?Cecily.  Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?Algernon.  No: the appointment is in London.Cecily.  Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep abusiness engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty oflife, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives.  Iknow he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.Algernon.  About my what?Cecily.  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to buy your outfit.Algernon.  I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit.  He has no tastein neckties at all.Cecily.  I don't think you will require neckties.  Uncle Jack is sendingyou to Australia.Algernon.  Australia!  I'd sooner die.Cecily.  Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would haveto choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.Algernon.  Oh, well!  The accounts I have received of Australia and thenext world, are not particularly encouraging.  This world is good enoughfor me, cousin Cecily.Cecily.  Yes, but are you good enough for it?Algernon.  I'm afraid I'm not that.  That is why I want you to reform me.You might make that your mission, if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.Cecily.  I'm afraid I've no time, this afternoon.Algernon.  Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?Cecily.  It is rather Quixotic of you.  But I think you should try.Algernon.  I will.  I feel better already.Cecily.  You are looking a little worse.Algernon.  That is because I am hungry.Cecily.  How thoughtless of me.  I should have remembered that when oneis going to lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesomemeals.  Won't you come in?Algernon.  Thank you.  Might I have a buttonhole first?  I never have anyappetite unless I have a buttonhole first.Cecily.  A Marechal Niel?  [Picks up scissors.]Algernon.  No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.Cecily.  Why?  [Cuts a flower.]Algernon.  Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.Cecily.  I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.Miss Prism never says such things to me.Algernon.  Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.  [Cecily puts therose in his buttonhole.]  You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.Cecily.  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.Algernon.  They are a snare that every sensible man would like to becaught in.Cecily.  Oh, I don't think I would care to catch a sensible man.  Ishouldn't know what to talk to him about.[They pass into the house.  Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]Miss Prism.  You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.  You should getmarried.  A misanthrope I can understand--a womanthrope, never!Chasuble.  [With a scholar's shudder.]  Believe me, I do not deserve soneologistic a phrase.  The precept as well as the practice of thePrimitive Church was distinctly against matrimony.Miss Prism.  [Sententiously.]  That is obviously the reason why thePrimitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.  And you do notseem to realise, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, aman converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should bemore careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.Chasuble.  But is a man not equally attractive when married?Miss Prism.  No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.Chasuble.  And often, I've been told, not even to her.Miss Prism.  That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman.Maturity can always be depended on.  Ripeness can be trusted.  Youngwomen are green.  [Dr. Chasuble starts.]  I spoke horticulturally.  Mymetaphor was drawn from fruits.  But where is Cecily?Chasuble.  Perhaps she followed us to the schools.[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden.  He is dressed in thedeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]Miss Prism.  Mr. Worthing!Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing?Miss Prism.  This is indeed a surprise.  We did not look for you tillMonday afternoon.Jack.  [Shakes Miss Prism's hand in a tragic manner.]  I have returnedsooner than I expected.  Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?Chasuble.  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betokensome terrible calamity?Jack.  My brother.Miss Prism.  More shameful debts and extravagance?Chasuble.  Still leading his life of pleasure?Jack.  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!Chasuble.  Your brother Ernest dead?Jack.  Quite dead.Miss Prism.  What a lesson for him!  I trust he will profit by it.Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence.  You have atleast the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generousand forgiving of brothers.Jack.  Poor Ernest!  He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.Chasuble.  Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?Jack.  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.  I had a telegram lastnight from the manager of the Grand Hotel.Chasuble.  Was the cause of death mentioned?Jack.  A severe chill, it seems.Miss Prism.  As a man sows, so shall he reap.Chasuble.  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!  Noneof us are perfect.  I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.  Willthe interment take place here?Jack.  No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.Chasuble.  In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points toany very serious state of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish meto make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction nextSunday.  [Jack presses his hand convulsively.]  My sermon on the meaningof the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion,joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I havepreached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on daysof humiliation and festal days.  The last time I delivered it was in theCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for thePrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders.  The Bishop, who waspresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.Jack.  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.Chasuble?  I suppose you know how to christen all right?  [Dr. Chasublelooks astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually christening,aren't you?Miss Prism.  It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector's most constantduties in this parish.  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on thesubject.  But they don't seem to know what thrift is.Chasuble.  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested,Mr. Worthing?  Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?Jack.  Oh yes.Miss Prism.  [Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usuallyare.Jack.  But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond ofchildren.  No! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, thisafternoon, if you have nothing better to do.Chasuble.  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?Jack.  I don't remember anything about it.Chasuble.  But have you any grave doubts on the subject?Jack.  I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don't know if the thingwould bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.Chasuble.  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion ofadults is a perfectly canonical practice.Jack.  Immersion!Chasuble.  You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that isnecessary, or indeed I think advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  Atwhat hour would you wish the ceremony performed?Jack.  Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.Chasuble.  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremoniesto perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in oneof the outlying cottages on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, amost hard-working man.Jack.  Oh!  I don't see much fun in being christened along with otherbabies.  It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?Chasuble.  Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I wouldmerely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to usbitter trials are often blessings in disguise.Miss Prism.  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.[Enter Cecily from the house.]Cecily.  Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horridclothes you have got on!  Do go and change them.Miss Prism.  Cecily!Chasuble.  My child! my child!  [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses herbrow in a melancholy manner.]Cecily.  What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as ifyou had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.  Who do youthink is in the dining-room?  Your brother!Jack.  Who?Cecily.  Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.Jack.  What nonsense!  I haven't got a brother.Cecily.  Oh, don't say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you inthe past he is still your brother.  You couldn't be so heartless as todisown him.  I'll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands withhim, won't you, Uncle Jack?  [Runs back into the house.]Chasuble.  These are very joyful tidings.Miss Prism.  After we had all been resigned to his loss, his suddenreturn seems to me peculiarly distressing.Jack.  My brother is in the dining-room?  I don't know what it all means.I think it is perfectly absurd.[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand.  They come slowly up to Jack.]Jack.  Good heavens!  [Motions Algernon away.]Algernon.  Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I amvery sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend tolead a better life in the future.  [Jack glares at him and does not takehis hand.]Cecily.  Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's hand?Jack.  Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming downhere disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.Cecily.  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernesthas just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whomhe goes to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one whois kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bedof pain.Jack.  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?Cecily.  Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terriblestate of health.Jack.  Bunbury!  Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury orabout anything else.  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.Algernon.  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But Imust say that I think that Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarlypainful.  I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially consideringit is the first time I have come here.Cecily.  Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will neverforgive you.Jack.  Never forgive me?Cecily.  Never, never, never!Jack.  Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.  [Shakes withAlgernon and glares.]Chasuble.  It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?I think we might leave the two brothers together.Miss Prism.  Cecily, you will come with us.Cecily.  Certainly, Miss Prism.  My little task of reconciliation isover.Chasuble.  You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.Miss Prism.  We must not be premature in our judgments.Cecily.  I feel very happy.  [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]Jack.  You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soonas possible.  I don't allow any Bunburying here.[Enter Merriman.]Merriman.  I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.I suppose that is all right?Jack.  What?Merriman.  Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it inthe room next to your own.Jack.  His luggage?Merriman.  Yes, sir.  Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes,and a large luncheon-basket.Algernon.  I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time.Jack.  Merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  Mr. Ernest has beensuddenly called back to town.Merriman.  Yes, sir.  [Goes back into the house.]Algernon.  What a fearful liar you are, Jack.  I have not been calledback to town at all.Jack.  Yes, you have.Algernon.  I haven't heard any one call me.Jack.  Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.Algernon.  My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasuresin the smallest degree.Jack.  I can quite understand that.Algernon.  Well, Cecily is a darling.Jack.  You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that.  I don't like it.Algernon.  Well, I don't like your clothes.  You look perfectlyridiculous in them.  Why on earth don't you go up and change?  It isperfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actuallystaying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest.  I call itgrotesque.Jack.  You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guestor anything else.  You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.Algernon.  I certainly won't leave you so long as you are in mourning.  Itwould be most unfriendly.  If I were in mourning you would stay with me,I suppose.  I should think it very unkind if you didn't.Jack.  Well, will you go if I change my clothes?Algernon.  Yes, if you are not too long.  I never saw anybody take solong to dress, and with such little result.Jack.  Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressedas you are.Algernon.  If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for itby being always immensely over-educated.Jack.  Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and yourpresence in my garden utterly absurd.  However, you have got to catch thefour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.  ThisBunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.[Goes into the house.]Algernon.  I think it has been a great success.  I'm in love with Cecily,and that is everything.[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden.  She picks up the can and beginsto water the flowers.]  But I must see her before I go, and makearrangements for another Bunbury.  Ah, there she is.Cecily.  Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.  I thought you werewith Uncle Jack.Algernon.  He's gone to order the dog-cart for me.Cecily.  Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?Algernon.  He's going to send me away.Cecily.  Then have we got to part?Algernon.  I am afraid so.  It's a very painful parting.Cecily.  It is always painful to part from people whom one has known fora very brief space of time.  The absence of old friends one can endurewith equanimity.  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom onehas just been introduced is almost unbearable.Algernon.  Thank you.[Enter Merriman.]Merriman.  The dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [Algernon looks appealinglyat Cecily.]Cecily.  It can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Exit Merriman.]Algernon.  I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quitefrankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visiblepersonification of absolute perfection.Cecily.  I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest.  If youwill allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.  [Goes over totable and begins writing in diary.]Algernon.  Do you really keep a diary?  I'd give anything to look at it.May I?Cecily.  Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a veryyoung girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequentlymeant for publication.  When it appears in volume form I hope you willorder a copy.  But pray, Ernest, don't stop.  I delight in taking downfrom dictation.  I have reached 'absolute perfection'.  You can go on.  Iam quite ready for more.Algernon.  [Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!Cecily.  Oh, don't cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speakfluently and not cough.  Besides, I don't know how to spell a cough.[Writes as Algernon speaks.]Algernon.  [Speaking very rapidly.]  Cecily, ever since I first lookedupon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love youwildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.Cecily.  I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.  Hopelessly doesn't seem to makemuch sense, does it?Algernon.  Cecily![Enter Merriman.]Merriman.  The dog-cart is waiting, sir.Algernon.  Tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.Merriman.  [Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.]  Yes, sir.[Merriman retires.]Cecily.  Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you werestaying on till next week, at the same hour.Algernon.  Oh, I don't care about Jack.  I don't care for anybody in thewhole world but you.  I love you, Cecily.  You will marry me, won't you?Cecily.  You silly boy!  Of course.  Why, we have been engaged for thelast three months.Algernon.  For the last three months?Cecily.  Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.Algernon.  But how did we become engaged?Cecily.  Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that hehad a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course haveformed the chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism.  Andof course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  Onefeels there must be something in him, after all.  I daresay it wasfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.Algernon.  Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?Cecily.  On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignoranceof my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, andafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old treehere.  The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this isthe little bangle with the true lover's knot I promised you always towear.Algernon.  Did I give you this?  It's very pretty, isn't it?Cecily.  Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It's the excuseI've always given for your leading such a bad life.  And this is the boxin which I keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box, andproduces letters tied up with blue ribbon.]Algernon.  My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never writtenyou any letters.Cecily.  You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only toowell that I was forced to write your letters for you.  I wrote alwaysthree times a week, and sometimes oftener.Algernon.  Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?Cecily.  Oh, I couldn't possibly.  They would make you far too conceited.[Replaces box.]  The three you wrote me after I had broken off theengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I canhardly read them without crying a little.Algernon.  But was our engagement ever broken off?Cecily.  Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see theentry if you like. [Shows diary.]  'To-day I broke off my engagement withErnest.  I feel it is better to do so.  The weather still continuescharming.'Algernon.  But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  Ihad done nothing at all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear youbroke it off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.Cecily.  It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if ithadn't been broken off at least once.  But I forgave you before the weekwas out.Algernon.  [Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel youare, Cecily.Cecily.  You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingersthrough his hair.]  I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?Algernon.  Yes, darling, with a little help from others.Cecily.  I am so glad.Algernon.  You'll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?Cecily.  I don't think I could break it off now that I have actually metyou.  Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.Algernon.  Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]Cecily.  You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been agirlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernonrises, Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems toinspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husbandis not called Ernest.Algernon.  But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love meif I had some other name?Cecily.  But what name?Algernon.  Oh, any name you like--Algernon--for instance . . .Cecily.  But I don't like the name of Algernon.Algernon.  Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I reallycan't see why you should object to the name of Algernon.  It is not atall a bad name.  In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.  Half of thechaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon.  Butseriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy,couldn't you love me?Cecily.  [Rising.]  I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire yourcharacter, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undividedattention.Algernon.  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, Isuppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites andceremonials of the Church?Cecily.  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has neverwritten a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.Algernon.  I must see him at once on a most important christening--I meanon most important business.Cecily.  Oh!Algernon.  I shan't be away more than half an hour.Cecily.  Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th,and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is ratherhard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?Algernon.  I'll be back in no time.[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]Cecily.  What an impetuous boy he is!  I like his hair so much.  I mustenter his proposal in my diary.[Enter Merriman.]Merriman.  A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing.  On veryimportant business, Miss Fairfax states.Cecily.  Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library?Merriman.  Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory sometime ago.Cecily.  Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to beback soon.  And you can bring tea.Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Goes out.]Cecily.  Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women whoare associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work inLondon.  I don't quite like women who are interested in philanthropicwork.  I think it is so forward of them.[Enter Merriman.]Merriman.  Miss Fairfax.[Enter Gwendolen.][Exit Merriman.]Cecily.  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you.My name is Cecily Cardew.Gwendolen.  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What avery sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be greatfriends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressionsof people are never wrong.Cecily.  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known eachother such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.Gwendolen.  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?Cecily.  With pleasure!Gwendolen.  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?Cecily.  If you wish.Gwendolen.  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?Cecily.  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]Gwendolen.  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for mymentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heardof papa, I suppose?Cecily.  I don't think so.Gwendolen.  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, isentirely unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seemsto me to be the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a manbegins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate,does he not?  And I don't like that.  It makes men so very attractive.Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, hasbrought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; sodo you mind my looking at you through my glasses?Cecily.  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am very fond of being looked at.Gwendolen.  [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.]  Youare here on a short visit, I suppose.Cecily.  Oh no!  I live here.Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some femalerelative of advanced years, resides here also?Cecily.  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.Gwendolen.  Indeed?Cecily.  My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has thearduous task of looking after me.Gwendolen.  Your guardian?Cecily.  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward.Gwendolen.  Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had award.  How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am notsure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixeddelight.  [Rising and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; Ihave liked you ever since I met you!  But I am bound to state that nowthat I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing awish you were--well, just a little older than you seem to be--and notquite so very alluring in appearance.  In fact, if I may speak candidly--Cecily.  Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant tosay, one should always be quite candid.Gwendolen.  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that youwere fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernesthas a strong upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour.Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.  But even men ofthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to theinfluence of the physical charms of others.  Modern, no less than AncientHistory, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to.If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.Cecily.  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?Gwendolen.  Yes.Cecily.  Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It ishis brother--his elder brother.Gwendolen.  [Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that hehad a brother.Cecily.  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a longtime.Gwendolen.  Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I havenever heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distastefulto most men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growingalmost anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come acrossa friendship like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quitesure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?Cecily.  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.Gwendolen.  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?Cecily.  [Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is noreason why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little countynewspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthingand I are engaged to be married.Gwendolen.  [Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think theremust be some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  Theannouncement will appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.Cecily.  [Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under somemisconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Showsdiary.]Gwendolen.  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It iscertainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterdayafternoon at 5.30.  If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.[Produces diary of her own.]  I never travel without my diary.  Oneshould always have something sensational to read in the train.  I am sosorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid Ihave the prior claim.Cecily.  It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen,if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound topoint out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed hismind.Gwendolen.  [Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped intoany foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once,and with a firm hand.Cecily.  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement mydear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after weare married.Gwendolen.  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  Youare presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than amoral duty to speak one's mind.  It becomes a pleasure.Cecily.  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into anengagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow maskof manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.Gwendolen.  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen aspade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.  He carries a salver, tablecloth, and plate stand.  Cecily is about to retort.  The presence of theservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girlschafe.]Merriman.  Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?Cecily.  [Sternly, in a calm voice.]  Yes, as usual.  [Merriman begins toclear table and lay cloth.  A long pause.  Cecily and Gwendolen glare ateach other.]Gwendolen.  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, MissCardew?Cecily.  Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quiteclose one can see five counties.Gwendolen.  Five counties!  I don't think I should like that; I hatecrowds.Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolenbites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]Gwendolen.  [Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, MissCardew.Cecily.  So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.Gwendolen.  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.Cecily.  Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are inLondon.Gwendolen.  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to existin the country, if anybody who is anybody does.  The country always boresme to death.Cecily.  Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression,is it not?  I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from itjust at present.  It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have beentold.  May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?Gwendolen.  [With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestablegirl!  But I require tea!Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  Sugar?Gwendolen.  [Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionableany more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts fourlumps of sugar into the cup.]Cecily.  [Severely.]  Cake or bread and butter?Gwendolen.  [In a bored manner.]  Bread and butter, please.  Cake israrely seen at the best houses nowadays.Cecily.  [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  Handthat to Miss Fairfax.[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  Gwendolen drinks the teaand makes a grimace.  Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to thebread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.  Rises inindignation.]Gwendolen.  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though Iasked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I amknown for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinarysweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.Cecily.  [Rising.]  To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from themachinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would notgo.Gwendolen.  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that youwere false and deceitful.  I am never deceived in such matters.  My firstimpressions of people are invariably right.Cecily.  It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on yourvaluable time.  No doubt you have many other calls of a similar characterto make in the neighbourhood.[Enter Jack.]Gwendolen.  [Catching sight of him.]  Ernest!  My own Ernest!Jack.  Gwendolen!  Darling!  [Offers to kiss her.]Gwendolen.  [Draws back.]  A moment!  May I ask if you are engaged to bemarried to this young lady?  [Points to Cecily.]Jack.  [Laughing.]  To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What couldhave put such an idea into your pretty little head?Gwendolen.  Thank you.  You may!  [Offers her cheek.]Cecily.  [Very sweetly.]  I knew there must be some misunderstanding,Miss Fairfax.  The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist ismy guardian, Mr. John Worthing.Gwendolen.  I beg your pardon?Cecily.  This is Uncle Jack.Gwendolen.  [Receding.]  Jack!  Oh![Enter Algernon.]Cecily.  Here is Ernest.Algernon.  [Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.]My own love!  [Offers to kiss her.]Cecily.  [Drawing back.]  A moment, Ernest!  May I ask you--are youengaged to be married to this young lady?Algernon.  [Looking round.]  To what young lady?  Good heavens!Gwendolen!Cecily.  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.Algernon.  [Laughing.]  Of course not!  What could have put such an ideainto your pretty little head?Cecily.  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.]  You may.[Algernon kisses her.]Gwendolen.  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.  Thegentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.Cecily.  [Breaking away from Algernon.]  Algernon Moncrieff!  Oh!  [Thetwo girls move towards each other and put their arms round each other'swaists as if for protection.]Cecily.  Are you called Algernon?Algernon.  I cannot deny it.Cecily.  Oh!Gwendolen.  Is your name really John?Jack.  [Standing rather proudly.]  I could deny it if I liked.  I coulddeny anything if I liked.  But my name certainly is John.  It has beenJohn for years.Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  A gross deception has been practised on both ofus.Gwendolen.  My poor wounded Cecily!Cecily.  My sweet wronged Gwendolen!Gwendolen.  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will younot?  [They embrace.  Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]Cecily.  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like tobe allowed to ask my guardian.Gwendolen.  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one questionI would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brotherErnest?  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so itis a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest isat present.Jack.  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painfulfor me to be forced to speak the truth.  It is the first time in my lifethat I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am reallyquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tellyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother atall.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not thesmallest intention of ever having one in the future.Cecily.  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?Jack.  [Cheerily.]  None!Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?Jack.  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even of an kind.Gwendolen.  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us isengaged to be married to any one.Cecily.  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly tofind herself in.  Is it?Gwendolen.  Let us go into the house.  They will hardly venture to comeafter us there.Cecily.  No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]Jack.  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, Isuppose?Algernon.  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The mostwonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life.Jack.  Well, you've no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.Algernon.  That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere onechooses.  Every serious Bunburyist knows that.Jack.  Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!Algernon.  Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants tohave any amusement in life.  I happen to be serious about Bunburying.What on earth you are serious about I haven't got the remotest idea.About everything, I should fancy.  You have such an absolutely trivialnature.Jack.  Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of thiswretched business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded.  Youwon't be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used todo, dear Algy.  And a very good thing too.Algernon.  Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he, dear Jack?  Youwon't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wickedcustom was.  And not a bad thing either.Jack.  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that yourtaking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable.To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward.Algernon.  I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving abrilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax.To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.Jack.  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.  I love her.Algernon.  Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily.  I adore her.Jack.  There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.Algernon.  I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and MissFairfax being united.Jack.  Well, that is no business of yours.Algernon.  If it was my business, I wouldn't talk about it.  [Begins toeat muffins.]  It is very vulgar to talk about one's business.  Onlypeople like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.Jack.  How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in thishorrible trouble, I can't make out.  You seem to me to be perfectlyheartless.Algernon.  Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butterwould probably get on my cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quitecalmly.  It is the only way to eat them.Jack.  I say it's perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, underthe circumstances.Algernon.  When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consolesme.  Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows meintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  Atthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, Iam particularly fond of muffins.  [Rising.]Jack.  [Rising.]  Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all inthat greedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]Algernon.  [Offering tea-cake.]  I wish you would have tea-cake instead.I don't like tea-cake.Jack.  Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his owngarden.Algernon.  But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eatmuffins.Jack.  I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances.That is a very different thing.Algernon.  That may be.  But the muffins are the same.  [He seizes themuffin-dish from Jack.]Jack.  Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.Algernon.  You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.It's absurd.  I never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, exceptvegetarians and people like that.  Besides I have just made arrangementswith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name ofErnest.Jack.  My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.  Imade arrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myselfat 5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.  Gwendolen wouldwish it.  We can't both be christened Ernest.  It's absurd.  Besides, Ihave a perfect right to be christened if I like.  There is no evidence atall that I have ever been christened by anybody.  I should think itextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble.  It is entirelydifferent in your case.  You have been christened already.Algernon.  Yes, but I have not been christened for years.Jack.  Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.Algernon.  Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you arenot quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I thinkit rather dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you veryunwell.  You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closelyconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by asevere chill.Jack.  Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.Algernon.  It usen't to be, I know--but I daresay it is now.  Science isalways making wonderful improvements in things.Jack.  [Picking up the muffin-dish.]  Oh, that is nonsense; you arealways talking nonsense.Algernon.  Jack, you are at the muffins again!  I wish you wouldn't.There are only two left.  [Takes them.]  I told you I was particularlyfond of muffins.Jack.  But I hate tea-cake.Algernon.  Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up foryour guests?  What ideas you have of hospitality!Jack.  Algernon!  I have already told you to go.  I don't want you here.Why don't you go!Algernon.  I haven't quite finished my tea yet! and there is still onemuffin left.  [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair.  Algernon stillcontinues eating.]ACT DROPTHIRD ACTSCENEMorning-room at the Manor House.[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]Gwendolen.  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house,as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have somesense of shame left.Cecily.  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.Gwendolen.  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all.Couldn't you cough?Cecily.  But I haven't got a cough.Gwendolen.  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!Cecily.  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.Gwendolen.  Let us preserve a dignified silence.Cecily.  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followedby Algernon.  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a BritishOpera.]Gwendolen.  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.Cecily.  A most distasteful one.Gwendolen.  But we will not be the first to speak.Cecily.  Certainly not.Gwendolen.  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.Much depends on your reply.Cecily.  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff,kindly answer me the following question.  Why did you pretend to be myguardian's brother?Algernon.  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactoryexplanation, does it not?Gwendolen.  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.Cecily.  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of hisanswer.Gwendolen.  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerityis the vital thing.  Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to mefor pretending to have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have anopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?Jack.  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?Gwendolen.  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend tocrush them.  This is not the moment for German scepticism.  [Moving toCecily.]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especiallyMr. Worthing's.  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.Cecily.  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voicealone inspires one with absolute credulity.Gwendolen.  Then you think we should forgive them?Cecily.  Yes.  I mean no.Gwendolen.  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake thatone cannot surrender.  Which of us should tell them?  The task is not apleasant one.Cecily.  Could we not both speak at the same time?Gwendolen.  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time asother people.  Will you take the time from me?Cecily.  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]Gwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]  Your Christian names are stillan insuperable barrier.  That is all!Jack and Algernon [Speaking together.]  Our Christian names!  Is thatall?  But we are going to be christened this afternoon.Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terriblething?Jack.  I am.Cecily.  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearfulordeal?Algernon.  I am!Gwendolen.  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Wherequestions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.Jack.  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]Cecily.  They have moments of physical courage of which we women knowabsolutely nothing.Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  Darling!Algernon.  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.][Enter Merriman.  When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]Merriman.  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!Jack.  Good heavens![Enter Lady Bracknell.  The couples separate in alarm.  Exit Merriman.]Lady Bracknell.  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?Gwendolen.  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,mamma.Lady Bracknell.  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitationof any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weaknessin the old.  [Turns to Jack.]  Apprised, sir, of my daughter's suddenflight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of asmall coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.  Her unhappyfather is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending amore than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme onthe Influence of a permanent income on Thought.  I do not propose toundeceive him.  Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.  Iwould consider it wrong.  But of course, you will clearly understand thatall communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediatelyfrom this moment.  On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.Jack.  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen Lady Bracknell!Lady Bracknell.  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regardsAlgernon! . . . Algernon!Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalidfriend Mr. Bunbury resides?Algernon.  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunburyis somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.Lady Bracknell.  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must havebeen extremely sudden.Algernon.  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poorBunbury died this afternoon.Lady Bracknell.  What did he die of?Algernon.  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.Lady Bracknell.  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  Ifso, he is well punished for his morbidity.Algernon.  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctorsfound out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean--so Bunburydied.Lady Bracknell.  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion ofhis physicians.  I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the lastto some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is nowholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?Jack.  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bowscoldly to Cecily.]Algernon.  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  I beg your pardon?Cecily.  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.Lady Bracknell.  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air ofthis particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements thatgo on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statisticshave laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary inquiry on mypart would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at allconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London?  I merelydesire information.  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were anyfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [Jack looks perfectlyfurious, but restrains himself.]Jack.  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter ofthe late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park,Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.Lady Bracknell.  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses alwaysinspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of theirauthenticity?Jack.  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  Theyare open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.Lady Bracknell.  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in thatpublication.Jack.  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, andMarkby.Lady Bracknell.  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highestposition in their profession.  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr.Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I amsatisfied.Jack.  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  Ihave also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates ofMiss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination,confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.Lady Bracknell.  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhapssomewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour ofpremature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the timeapproaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matterof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any littlefortune?Jack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  Thatis all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  Ahundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seemsto me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls ofthe present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualitiesthat last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age ofsurfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.]Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost asNature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughlyexperienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a verybrief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,and after three months her own husband did not know her.Jack.  And after six months nobody knew her.Lady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with apractised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecilyturns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecilypresents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinctsocial possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age areits want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher,dear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are wornvery high, just at present.  Algernon!Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!Lady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew'sprofile.Algernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the wholeworld.  And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.Lady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Onlypeople who can't get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, ofcourse you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married LordBracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a momentof allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give myconsent.Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!Cecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.Lady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.Lady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of longengagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out eachother's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.Jack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but thisengagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew's guardian,and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  Thatconsent I absolutely decline to give.Lady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely,I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing,but he looks everything.  What more can one desire?Jack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, LadyBracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve atall of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernonand Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]Lady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is anOxonian.Jack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  Thisafternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important questionof romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the falsepretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I've justbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing hisdisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon inalienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed totea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct allthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the firstthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don'tintend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him somyself yesterday afternoon.Lady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I havedecided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.Jack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision,however, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.Lady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goesover.]  How old are you, dear?Cecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twentywhen I go to evening parties.Lady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slightalteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about herage.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen,but admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be verylong before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  SoI don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of anyimportance.Jack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but itis only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather'swill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.Lady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-five is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of thevery highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my ownknowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age offorty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecilyshould not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than sheis at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.Cecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?Algernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.Cecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rathercross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality inothers, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.Algernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?Cecily.  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.Lady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positivelythat she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am boundto say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg ofyou to reconsider your decision.Jack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your ownhands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will mostgladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.Lady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quiteaware that what you propose is out of the question.Jack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forwardto.Lady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six,trains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]Chasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.Lady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?Chasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.Lady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was theway in which you wasted your time and money.Chasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christeningsat all this afternoon?Jack.  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of muchpractical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.Chasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I havecompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as yourpresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to thechurch at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener thatfor the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in thevestry.Lady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a MissPrism?Chasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.Lady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This mattermay prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Isthis Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected witheducation?Chasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies,and the very picture of respectability.Lady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask whatposition she holds in your household?Chasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.Jack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the lastthree years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.Lady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.Let her be sent for.Chasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]Miss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  Ihave been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catchessight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  MissPrism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous toescape.]Lady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bowsher head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in ahumble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  TheCanon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious toshield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible publicscandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell'shouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulatorthat contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weekslater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in aremote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of athree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [MissPrism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there![Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]Miss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  Ionly wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morningof the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, Iprepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had alsowith me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended toplace the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during myfew unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which Inever can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette,and placed the baby in the hand-bag.Jack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you depositthe hand-bag?Miss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.Jack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  Iinsist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained thatinfant.Miss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railwaystations in London.Jack.  What railway station?Miss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks intoa chair.]Jack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here forme.Gwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all mylife.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]Chasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?Lady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardlytell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are notsupposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Everyone looks up.]Cecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.Chasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.Lady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if hewas having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They arealways vulgar, and often convincing.Chasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]Lady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.Gwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jackwith a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]Jack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?Examine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than onelife depends on your answer.Miss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury itreceived through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger andhappier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion ofa temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  Andhere, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in anextravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedlymine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It hasbeen a great inconvenience being without it all these years.Jack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you thanthis hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.Miss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?Jack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!Miss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I amunmarried!Jack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all,who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannotrepentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law formen, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embraceher again.]Miss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.[Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who youreally are.Jack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, butwould you kindly inform me who I am?Lady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will notaltogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.Jack.  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew Ihad a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,--how could youhave ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr.Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you willhave to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behavedto me like a brother in all your life.Algernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best,however, though I was out of practice.[Shakes hands.]Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is yourChristian name, now that you have become some one else?Jack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Yourdecision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?Gwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.Cecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!Jack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta,a moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had Ibeen christened already?Lady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, includingchristening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.Jack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was Igiven?  Let me know the worst.Lady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened afteryour father.Jack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?Lady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recallwhat the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one.He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was theresult of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and otherthings of that kind.Jack.  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?Algernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He diedbefore I was a year old.Jack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,Aunt Augusta?Lady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except inhis domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in anymilitary directory.Jack.  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.  These delightfulrecords should have been my constant study.  [Rushes to bookcase andtears the books out.]  M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, whatghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!  Lieutenant1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christiannames, Ernest John.  [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quitecalmly.]  I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I?Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.Lady Bracknell.  Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest,I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.Gwendolen.  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  I felt from the first that you couldhave no other name!Jack.  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenlythat all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  Can youforgive me?Gwendolen.  I can.  For I feel that you are sure to change.Jack.  My own one!Chasuble.  [To Miss Prism.]  Laetitia!  [Embraces her]Miss Prism.  [Enthusiastically.]  Frederick!  At last!Algernon.  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At last!Jack.  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At last!Lady Bracknell.  My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs oftriviality.Jack.  On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've now realised for the firsttime in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.TABLEAU
